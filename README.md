# Odin Recipes

This is my first project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal is to create a basic recipe website using only HTML. This project will help me practice the following skills:

- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML
- Creating and linking multiple HTML files
- Using proper indentation and formatting
- Organizing files and folders in a clean project structure
- Writing descriptive content and using heading tags properly

Once I complete this project, Iâ€™ll be more confident in writing clean HTML and building simple websites from scratch without using any CSS or JavaScript yet.
